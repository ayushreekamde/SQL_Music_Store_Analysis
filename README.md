# SQL Music Store Analysis

This project involves analyzing a music store's data using SQL on PostgreSQL. The goal is to derive insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and music inventory performance.

## Features
- Schema design for a music store database.
- Data insertion scripts for populating tables.
- Analytical SQL queries for insights like:
  - Top-selling tracks.
  - Customer spending patterns.
  - Revenue by genre.

## Project Structure
- `queries/`: SQL scripts for database setup, data insertion, and analysis.
- `data/`: Sample datasets and schema diagrams.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project.

## Requirements
- PostgreSQL (Version X.X or higher)
- Basic understanding of SQL.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/SQL_Music_Store_Analysis.git
   ```
2. Set up the database:
   ```bash
   psql -U username -d database_name -f queries/create_tables.sql
   ```
3. Insert data:
   ```bash
   psql -U username -d database_name -f queries/insert_data.sql
   ```
4. Run analysis queries:
   ```bash
   psql -U username -d database_name -f queries/analysis_queries.sql
   ```

## Insights
Key findings from the analysis include:
- List insights youâ€™ve derived, such as "Rock is the most popular genre" or "Most customers spend less than $20."

## Future Scope
- Add advanced queries for deeper insights.
- Integrate with a visualization tool like Tableau or Power BI.
